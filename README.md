# Face Recognition Wheelchair Control App

This repository contains a Python application that utilizes OpenCV models for face recognition to control a small wheelchair using a NodeMCU. The application captures video from a camera and analyzes it in real-time to detect faces. Once a face is recognized, the corresponding control signal is sent to the NodeMCU, enabling wheelchair control.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NodeMCU board
- Arduino IDE


## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/mhmodjoney/face-recognition

2. Install the required Python libraries:
3. Connect the NodeMCU to your computer and upload the Arduino sketch provided in the `node_mcu` directory using the Arduino IDE.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a face recognition wheelchair control application that aims to provide individuals with complete paralysis greater mobility and independence. By leveraging the power of facial recognition technology, this application allows users to control a wheelchair using their face, enabling them to move more freely and navigate their environment with ease.

### Impact

The impact of this project is significant, as it addresses the challenges faced by individuals with complete paralysis who have limited or no control over their limbs. By utilizing facial recognition technology, the application provides an intuitive and accessible control mechanism for wheelchair movement. This empowers individuals to navigate their surroundings, interact with others, and engage in daily activities independently, ultimately enhancing their quality of life.
